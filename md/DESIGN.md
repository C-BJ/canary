# Design of Jaye

## Functions
In Jaye functions are done differently from most other programming<br>
languages.

```
const function_name: i32(n: i32) = {
    return n
}
```

## Datatypes
In Jaye we do a mix of Go style and Rust style datatypes.
```
int, i8, i16, i32, i64,
uint, u8, u16, u32, u64
float, f32, f64
```
